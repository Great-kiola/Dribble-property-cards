This is an attempt to create a design i found on dribble and make it a draggable card.

## What i learned

I learnt a lot of things from this simple project that i saw on dribble while browsing through, few of which were

- I learnt how to create a JSON file with parameters that would later be used
- I learnt how to use fetch to fetch data from the JSON file that was created
- I was able to work more with my positions.
- Grid is still quite a problem, but its something i'm working on improving.
